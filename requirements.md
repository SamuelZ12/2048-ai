Overview of the AI Logic
The AI will use an expectimax search algorithm to decide the best move at each step, considering the game's randomness (new tiles appearing). It will evaluate possible moves up to a limited depth and use a heuristic function to assess board states, aiming to maximize the score. The AI will operate within the BotManager class, triggered by the on/off button, and interact with the GameManager to execute moves.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Integration with the On/Off Button
Trigger Mechanism: Utilize the existing BotManager class in bot_manager.js. The on/off button is already linked to the .bot-button element, toggling the isEnabled flag via an event listener. When isEnabled is true, the AI should start making moves autonomously.
Move Execution Loop: In the makeNextMove method, if isEnabled is true, the AI computes the best move and calls gameManager.move(direction) to execute it. After each move, schedule the next move using setTimeout with a delay based on moveSpeed (e.g., 66ms for 15 FPS), continuing until the game ends or isEnabled becomes false.
2. Expectimax Search Algorithm
Core Concept: Implement an expectimax search with two types of nodes:
Max Nodes: Represent the AI's move choices (up, right, down, left). The AI selects the move yielding the highest expected value.
Chance Nodes: Represent the random placement of new tiles (2 with 90% probability, 4 with 10%) in empty cells after a move. Compute the expected value by averaging over all possibilities.
Depth Limit: Limit the search to a fixed depth (e.g., 3-5 moves ahead) to balance computation speed and decision quality, ensuring responsiveness in the browser environment.
Process:
Start with the current grid state from gameManager.grid.
For each possible move (0: up, 1: right, 2: down, 3: left):
Simulate the move to get a new grid state.
If the move changes the grid, evaluate the resulting state via chance nodes.
Recursively explore deeper states until the depth limit is reached, then apply a heuristic.
3. Simulating Moves
Grid Copying: Use the existing copyGrid method in bot_manager.js to create a copy of the current grid for simulation, avoiding modifications to the actual game state.
Move Simulation: Leverage the canMove method's logic (which simulates a move using getVector and buildTraversals from game_manager.js) and extend it to:
Move and merge tiles according to 2048 rules.
Return the new grid state after the move.
New Tile Placement: After a valid move, simulate the random addition of a 2 (90%) or 4 (10%) tile in each empty cell. Calculate the expected value by weighting each outcome by its probability divided by the number of empty cells.
4. Heuristic Function
Purpose: At the depth limit (leaf nodes) or when the game ends, evaluate the board state to estimate its potential for achieving a high score.
Components: Combine the following factors with tunable weights:
Sum of Tile Values: Encourages higher tiles (e.g., sumOfTiles = total of all tile values).
Number of Empty Cells: Promotes flexibility (e.g., numEmpty * 1000, where 1000 is a weight to prioritize open spaces).
Optional Enhancements:
Smoothness: Minimize differences between adjacent tiles to facilitate merges.
Monotonicity: Favor tiles arranged in increasing or decreasing order along rows/columns.
Corner Bonus: Add a bonus (e.g., 1000) if the maximum tile is in a corner.
Example Formula: heuristic = sumOfTiles + 1000 * numEmpty. Start simple and adjust weights based on performance.
Game Over Handling: If no moves are possible (check via movesAvailable in game_manager.js), return the current score or a low value (e.g., -infinity) to penalize terminal states.
5. Implementing the Logic in bot_manager.js
Replace findBestMove: Currently, findBestMove prioritizes down (2) or left (3) moves. Replace this with the expectimax logic:
Define an expectimaxSearch function that takes the grid and depth as inputs and returns the best move.
Max Node Logic: For each direction, simulate the move, check if it alters the grid (using canMove or a similar check), and recursively evaluate the chance nodes.
Chance Node Logic: For each empty cell in the new grid, simulate placing a 2 or 4, compute the heuristic or recurse, and average the values weighted by probabilities (0.9 / numEmpty for 2, 0.1 / numEmpty for 4).
Leaf Node: At depth 0 or game over, return the heuristic value.
Return Value: expectimaxSearch returns the direction (0-3) with the highest expected value, which makeNextMove passes to gameManager.move.
6. Performance Optimization
Depth Selection: Start with a depth of 3 to ensure quick decisions (e.g., <100ms per move). Test and adjust (e.g., 4 or 5) based on responsiveness.
Move Filtering: Use canMove to skip invalid moves early, reducing computation.
Time Constraint: Ensure each move calculation fits within moveSpeed (e.g., 66ms at 15 FPS) to avoid UI lag. If needed, reduce depth dynamically.
7. Interaction with Game State
Accessing the Grid: Get the current grid via this.gameManager.grid in BotManager.
Move Execution: Use this.gameManager.move(direction) to apply the chosen move, which updates the game state and adds a random tile (handled by game_manager.js).
Game Over Check: After each move, check this.gameManager.isGameTerminated() to stop the AI loop if the game ends.
8. Visualization and Control
Delay Between Moves: Retain the setTimeout delay in makeNextMove using moveSpeed, adjustable via the slider in index.html (linked to addSpeedControls in bot_manager.js), so users can observe moves.
On/Off Toggle: The .bot-button already toggles isEnabled. Ensure makeNextMove respects this flag, halting when isEnabled is false.
9. Handling Edge Cases
No Valid Moves: If findBestMove returns null (no moves possible), stop the AI loop, as the game is over.
Randomness: Account for the game's inherent randomness (new tile placement) by averaging over all possibilities in chance nodes, reflecting the 90%/10% probabilities defined in addRandomTile (in game_manager.js).
Summary of Key Functions
makeNextMove: Checks isEnabled, calls findBestMove, executes the move, and schedules the next move with delay.
findBestMove: Orchestrates expectimax search, returning the best direction.
expectimaxSearch: Recursively evaluates max and chance nodes up to the depth limit, using a heuristic at leaf nodes.
Heuristic: Combines tile sum and empty cells (optionally smoothness, monotonicity, etc.) to score board states.
Integration Notes
Existing Code Leverage: Use copyGrid and canMove from bot_manager.js for simulation, and move from game_manager.js for execution.
UI Responsiveness: The fixed depth and move delay ensure the AI doesn’t freeze the browser, aligning with JavaScript’s single-threaded nature.
Scalability: While designed for a 4x4 grid (per game_manager.js), the logic can adapt to other sizes by adjusting grid access and simulation loops.
