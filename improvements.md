# Improvement Suggestions for 2048 AI Project

1. **Clean up your repository structure**
   - Remove the duplicate `/.github` directory. You only need one at the root.
   - Move everything under `js/` into `src/js/` and styles into `src/styles/`, emitting only compiled assets to `dist/`.

2. **Introduce a modern build pipeline**
   - Add a `package.json` and manage dependencies via npm (or Yarn).
   - Configure a bundler (Webpack/Rollup/Parcel) to:
     - Bundle ES6 modules.
     - Compile SCSS to CSS with PostCSS/autoprefixer and minification.
   - Create npm scripts for `build`, `watch`, and `serve`.

3. **Modularize and refactor your JavaScript**
   - Convert each file (e.g., `game_manager.js`, `bot_manager.js`) into ES6 modules.
   - Extract Expectimax logic into its own `expectimax.js` module: `search(grid, depth) → { move, score }`.
   - DRY up duplicate loops in `makeRandomMove` and `makeNextMove` with shared helpers.

4. **Adopt linting and formatting tools**
   - Install ESLint (e.g., Airbnb or Standard) and Prettier.
   - Integrate them into CI so that builds fail on lint errors.

5. **Add automated testing**
   - Set up Jest or Mocha/Chai.
   - Write unit tests for:
     - `Grid` operations (insert, merge, serialize).
     - Expectimax output on predefined boards.
   - Add a `test` script and include it in CI.

6. **Strengthen CI/CD workflow**
   - Update your GitHub Actions workflow to run build, lint, and tests before deployment.
   - Publish only the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages.
   - Cache `node_modules` for faster runs.

7. **Optimize performance**
   - Remove unnecessary polyfills if targeting modern browsers.
   - Break heavy Expectimax calls into smaller chunks to avoid blocking the UI.
   - In `HTMLActuator`, update only changed tiles instead of clearing everything each frame.

8. **Improve accessibility and UX**
   - Add ARIA roles and labels for controls and messages.
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard‑focusable and labelled.
   - Test touch/swipe interactions on various devices; consider a lightweight touch library.

9. **Streamline assets**
   - Compress and convert icons/images (favicon, Apple startup) to WebP/AVIF with fallbacks.
   - Subset fonts to include only needed glyphs (e.g., digits and UI characters) and serve WOFF2.

10. **Enhance documentation**
    - Expand `README.md` with installation, development, build/deploy steps, and contribution guidelines.
    - Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
    - Use JSDoc comments to document public APIs.
